Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

```Terraform commands
terraform validate  --  To validate the configuration
terraform plan      --  preview the changes that Terraform plans to make to your infrastructure 
terraform apply     --  pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan.
```
    
## Optimizations

## Appendix

Supports the use of randomness within Terraform configurations. This is a logical provider, which means that it works entirely within Terraform logic, and does not interact with any other services.
